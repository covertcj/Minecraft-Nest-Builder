spawn termites
main loop:
   move termites
   lay blocks
   update pheromones

update pheromones:
   diffuse pheromone
   decay pheronome
   lay pheromone

move termites:
   move path following termites m steps
   move block laying pheromones m steps
   
lay blocks:
   for each termite:
      if pheromone at location .5< and <.8
         lay block with probability p
         set building pheromone at that block to k

diffuse pheromone:
   increase or decrease pheromones in each block according the gradient between adjacent block

lay pheronome:
   lay trail pheromone
   lay queen pheromone
